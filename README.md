# What can I do with TestingSystem?
TestingSystem App is a fully automated system for online testing: reducing assessment time and ensuring that the results obtained are accurate!

The system allows you to register as an Examiner or a Student.

As an Examiner you can create and modify your test with different types of question:

1. true-or-false question
2. multiply choice question
3. free-text question

* Schedule your test to be active at a specific time or to be available at all times
* Create your own Group and add students to it! After being added to the group, Student will get a welcome-email notification
* Get statistical passages by group at any given time or as a scheduled monthly statistic!

As a Student, you can take the tests and check your result upon completion of the test!
